# Hell-O!

### Who Am I?

UI Developer at [Leanspace](https://leanspace.io/).

I love everything that has to do with visual design, web projects as well as typography, identity & branding, and animations. With my design & development experience, I know how to help clients solve real project plans and grow their businesses through design thinking.

The design I like is minimalist, efficient, calm, and elegant, with a special affection for typography.

I've previously worked in the print industry as a Graphic Designer, a Digital Printer as well as an Offset Printer — with a demonstrated history of working in the French press, agency, and pharmaceutical packaging industries.
